    * It's now possible to recourse against the same person again
    * The last person in the chain can now reject a recourse (was broken before)

    * We now are also able to differentiate between a payment not being sent, being in the mem pool, being paid and unconfirmed and paid and confirmed
    * Add payment state for sell, recourse and bill payments to DB (breaking DB change - reset IndexedDB)
    * Restructure `BillCurrentWaitingState` to remove duplication (breaking API change - check `index.d.ts`)
        * Add info for if a payment is in the mempool with it's transaction id, as well as how many confirmations it has, in the bill data (breaking DB change - reset IndexedDB)

# 0.3.17

* Changed minted proofs token format from cashu Token v3 to BitcrB (v4)
* Use NodeId, PublicKey, SecretKey and BillId types internally instead of strings (fully breaking)
    * This breaks all existing databases, since the node ids and bill ids now have the format `prefix|network|pubkey`- example: `bitcrt03f9f94d1fdc2090d46f3524807e3f58618c36988e69577d70d5d4d1e9e9645a4f`
    * The `prefix` is `bitcr`
    * The `network` character is as follows:
        * m => Mainnet
        * t => Testnet
        * T => Testnet4
        * r => Regtest
    * The `pubkey` is a stringified secp256k1 public key
    * Existing apps need to a.) delete their IndexedDB and b.) their localhost (because the mint ID might be in there)

* Add the possibility to add anonymous contacts
  * They only have Node Id, Name and E-Mail as fields
  * E-Mail is optional
  * This changes the data model for contacts, `email` and `postal_address` are now optional
    * Additional validation rules ensure the fields can only be set for non-anon contacts

* Fix a small issue, where bills were recalculated instead of taken from cache, once their payment/sell/recourse/accept requests expired
* Change behaviour of request to pay
  * it's now possible to req to pay before the maturity date
  * The actual payment expiry still only happens 2 workdays after the end of the maturity date,
    or end of the req to pay end of day if that was after the maturity date
  * the `request_to_pay_timed_out` flag is set after payment expired, not after the req to pay expired
  * The waiting state for payment is only active during the req to pay (while it's blocked)
    * Afterwards, the bill is not blocked anymore, can still be rejected to pay and paid
    * But recourse is only possible after the payment expired (after maturity date)
  * An expired req to pay, which expired before the maturity date does not show up in `past_payments`

So files can only be uploaded individually, but for `issue()`, `file_upload_ids`
can be passed - a list of file upload ids, to upload multiple files for one bill.
* Restructured `BitcreditBillWeb` to a more structured approach, separating `status`,
`data` and `participants` and adding the concept of `current_waiting_state`, to
have all data available, if the bill is in a waiting state.
  * Added the concept of `redeemed_funds_available` on `status`, to indicate if
    the caller has funds available (e.g. from a sale, or a paid bill)
