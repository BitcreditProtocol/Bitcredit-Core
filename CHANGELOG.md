# 0.3.1

* Added `log_level` to Config, which defaults to `info`
* Changed the API for uploading files to bill to use `file` instead of `files`.
So files can only be uploaded individually, but for `issue()`, `file_upload_ids`
can be passed - a list of file upload ids, to upload multiple files for one bill.
* Restructured `BitcreditBillWeb` to a more structured approach, separating `status`,
`data` and `participants` and adding the concept of `current_waiting_state`, to
have all data available, if the bill is in a waiting state.
    * Added the concept of `redeemed_funds_available` on `status`, to indicate if
    the caller has funds available (e.g. from a sale, or a paid bill)

# 0.3.0

* First version exposing a WASM API
