# Web Setup

### Building

Make sure to have at least Rust version 1.85 as well as a recent version of the toolchain installed.

#### On Ubuntu
```bash
# Install libs
sudo apt install -y libclang-dev pkg-config build-essential
```

#### On Fedora
```bash
# Install libs
sudo dnf install -y make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel clang-devel
sudo dnf install -y pkgconf-pkg-config @development-tools
```

#### On Windows
```bash
# Using MSYS2 terminal
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-make mingw-w64-x86_64-llvm
pacman -S base-devel pkgconf
```

Finally build the backend
```bash
cargo build

# or with embedded db
cargo build --features embedded-db
```

Start the backend server in development mode:

```bash
# Run with defaults
RUST_LOG=info cargo run

# configure listening ports and addresses
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -- --http-port 8001 --http-address 0.0.0.0

# Run with embedded database feature, data stored in data/surreal
cargo run --features embedded-db -- --surreal-db-connection rocksdb://data/surreal
```

### Development

Start the app in development mode with hot reloading
(requires two terminals):

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo watch -x run  # watch can be installed with cargo install cargo-watch
```

### API docs

OpenApi specs and a Swagger UI are available at [http://localhost:8000/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:8000/swagger-ui/) when running the service.

### Docker

The docker build requires no dependencies other than docker or podman. It can
also be used to run multiple instances of the app on different ports for testing
the P2P functionality.

#### Build a standalone docker image

Build the image:

```bash
# The image name can be changed to whatever you want
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

Launch the image:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 1908:1908 -e RUST_LOG=info <image-name>
```

You should be able to open the app at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/]([http://127.0.0.1:8000/])

#### Run with docker-compose

Build and launch the app with docker-compose running on a different port than
the default 8000:

```bash
# run in foreground, can be stopped using CTRL+C
docker-compose up

# run in background, can be stopped using docker-compose stop
docker-compose up -d

# rebuild the image
docker-compose build
```

If you use the above commands, the application state (identity, bills, contacts)
will persist between sessions. However, if you use `docker-compose down`, or
`docker-compose rm`, the existing container gets removed, along with it's state.
Of course, rebuilding the image also removes the application state.

### SurrealDB

For development it is advised to use a local SurrealDB instance running as a
separate service as compile times are quite long. In production builds SurrealDB
will be available as an embedded database in the application. SurrealDB listens
on port 8000 by default which is the same as the default port for the application
so make sure to change the SurrealDB port or application port before running the
services.

#### Connect to SurrealDB

When the application has been built with the `embedded-db` feature, it allows to
use the application with a `rocksdb://path/to/db` connection string otherwise you
need to connect the the database via web-socket like: `ws://localhost:8800`.

#### Run SurrealDB for development

```bash
# build the application with surrealdb embedded
cargo build --features embedded-db

# start surrealdb container included in docker-compose.yml (listening 8800)
docker-compose up -d surrealdb

# with surrealdb installed on your local machine (listening on port 8800)
surrealdb start --unauthenticated --bind 127.0.0.1:8800
```

#### Explore the database with Surrealist

To work with and explore the database, you can use
[Surrealist](https://surrealdb.com/surrealist) which is an interactive interface
for SurrealDB.
